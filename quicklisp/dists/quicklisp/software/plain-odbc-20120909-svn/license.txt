
This system contains code from Paul Meurer and Roland Averkamp.

David Owen made the necessary adjustments to the code to 
make it run on 64-bit Linux.

This system contains code from Paul Meurer:
the FFC system was written by him and also
the lower level parts of the system: 
src/odbc/odbc-constants.lisp
src/odbc/odbc-ff-interface.lisp
src/odbc/ odbc-functions.lisp
(I removed code that I did not need.)

and this is his license

 SQL/ODBC module for MCL, CMUCL, LispWorks, ACL and CormanLisp
